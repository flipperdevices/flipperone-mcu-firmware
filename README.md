### Flipper One uses a dual-processor architecture:

* **Low-Power MCU** (Raspberry Pi RP2350)  
  Buttons, LCD display, touchpad, and LEDs are physically connected to the MCU. It also manages battery and power control.  
  To render graphics on the LCD from Linux, the main CPU transfers display data to the MCU over SPI.  
  When the device is powered off, the MCU controls power-bank mode and system power states.  
  The MCU also participates in booting the main CPU.

* **High-Performance Linux CPU** (Rockchip RK3576)  
  This processor runs Linux, and all high-level peripherals are connected to it: USB, HDMI, M.2, Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and audio.

The MCU and CPU are interconnected via several interfaces: SPI, I²C, and UART. Additional GPIO lines are used for BOOT_1, BOOT_2, and IRQ signals.

## Join development

* Check the public task tracker: [MCU Firmware Project](https://github.com/orgs/flipperdevices/projects/8)

* Read the documentation: [docs.flipper.net/one/tech-specs](https://docs.flipper.net/one/tech-specs)  
  ⚠️ *Co-processor architecture documentation is coming soon (TODO).*
